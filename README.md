# UNSW-NB15-Dataset-Intrusion-Detection-System

With the rise of Internet usage, it is very important to protect Networks. The
most common risk to a networkâ€™s security is an intrusion such as brute force,
denial of service or even an infiltration from within a network.


Evaluating NIDS(Network Intrusion Detection System)s using the existing
benchmark data sets of KDD99 and NSLKDD does not reflect satisfactory
results, due to three major issues: (1) their lack of modern low footprint attack
styles, (2) their lack of modern normal traffic scenarios, and (3) a different
distribution of training and testing sets. To address these issues, the
UNSW-NB15 data set has recently been generated. This data set has nine types
of the modern attacks fashions and new patterns of normal traffic, and it
contains 49 attributes that comprise the flow based between hosts and the
network packets inspection to discriminate between the observations, either
normal or abnormal.


Certain ML techniques have been evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The
accuracy and false alarm rate of the techniques are assessed, and the results
compared with previous research and our findings of the problem. The best
machine learning techniques and flow identifiers of source/destination IP
addresses and protocols can effectively and efficiently detect botnets and their
origins as a Network forensic mechanism.
